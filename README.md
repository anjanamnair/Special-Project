"Real-Time Collaboration on Building Models" presents a robust framework aimed at improving communication and collaboration within architectural design and building information modeling (BIM) processes. The project introduces a novel approach utilizing serialized XML objects to facilitate real-time updates to Resource Description Framework (RDF) data, crucial for structuring information in the construction industry. Leveraging Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), the project ensures standardized BIM data exchange, complemented by the use of queries to accurately reflect modifications in BIM models. Serialization and deserialization processes are integrated to enhance data exchange efficiency. A robust communication infrastructure supports real-time collaboration among stakeholders, with notifications enabling prompt updates. Implementation details cover RDF data handling, SPARQL query construction, serialization of update queries into XML format, and TCP communication for data transmission. The client-server architecture enables seamless exchange and manipulation of RDF data between systems. The project's success lies in its ability to enable real-time collaboration and synchronization between Revit models and IFC files, bridging gaps in BIM workflows and ensuring efficiency and accuracy. Key findings highlight achievements in automating updates to IFC files through innovative SPARQL queries and robust communication infrastructure. Technological choices, such as the XBIM and dotNet RDF libraries, underscore the project's effectiveness in enhancing BIM workflows. Overall, "Real-Time Collaboration on Building Models" offers a comprehensive solution to industry challenges, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in architectural design and construction processes through real-time collaboration and synchronization mechanisms.
